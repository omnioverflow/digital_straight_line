## Abstract

Main idea beind this work is to compute pre-images of lines discretization in a mathematically correct way using Boost Rational Library.
That will allow us to avoid floating-point errors and experimentally obtain initial hints of the polygonal shape of pre-image sets:
* whether pre-image sets are convex/compact/simplex, etc.

Experimental results will give clear hints on formal mathematical proof.
